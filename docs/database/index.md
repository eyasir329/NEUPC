## Row Level Security (RLS)

RLS is enabled on every table. The general policy pattern:

| Operation | Policy |
|---|---|
| SELECT on public data | `true` (everyone can read published content) |
| SELECT on own data | `auth.uid() = user_id` |
| INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | Handled via `supabaseAdmin` in server actions — RLS bypassed intentionally for writes that require elevated access |
| Sensitive fields | Never returned to client — filtered in `data-service.js` query selects |

> The `supabaseAdmin` client (service role key) is used **only** in server-side code (`app/_lib/*-actions.js`, `app/api/*`). It is never imported in components or page files.

## Useful SQL Snippets

```sql
-- Make the first user an admin
UPDATE users SET account_status = 'active' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id)
  SELECT u.id, r.id FROM users u, roles r
  WHERE u.email = 'your@email.com' AND r.name = 'admin';

-- Check all role assignments
SELECT u.email, r.name AS role
FROM users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON ur.user_id = u.id
JOIN roles r ON r.id = ur.role_id
ORDER BY u.email;

-- Pending membership applications
SELECT * FROM join_requests WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at;

-- Platform stats
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE account_status = 'active') AS active_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE status = 'published') AS published_events,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts WHERE status = 'published') AS published_blogs;
```
